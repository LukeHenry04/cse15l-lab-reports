The `grep` command can be used to search for lines containing a pattern, such as a string like "Italy", in a file. 

Using the command `grep --help` in Windows, or `man grep` on other operating systems, I found the following options that modify the function of the `grep` command:

- `-c` - count
- `-i` - ignore case
- `-r` - recursive
- `-o` - only matching
