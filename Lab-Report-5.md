**Creating a bash script for Lab Report 4**

The challenge was to complete the following steps as fast as possible:

- Log into ieng6
- Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account
- Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
- Edit the code file to fix the failing test
- Run the tests, demonstrating that they now succeed
- Commit and push the resulting change to your Github account
